# Policy-Service

# What is the Azure Policy Service?
- Policy service is another security feature that allows admins to impose restrictions on Azure resources
- There are a ton of built-in policies and they are used from a governance perspective
- Admins can also create custom policies
- Examples: Ensuring all VMs have Antimalware extension installed or ensuring all resource groups have tags in place.

# Assign the IaaSAntimalware Extension policy to your subscription
- This policy checks that VMs in the subscription have the extension installed.
- Reminder - we assigned this policy at the subscription level. 
- We could exclude particular resource groups if we wanted to.

# Admins will be able to see in the overview section which policies were triggers
- Here we can see that the VMs that we created are non-compliant under IaaSmAntimalware extension
