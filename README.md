# Policy-Service

# What is the Azure Policy Service?
- Policy service is another security feature that allows admins to impose restrictions on Azure resources
- There are a ton of built-in policies and they are used from a governance perspective
- Admins can also create custom policies
- Examples: Ensuring all VMs have Antimalware extension installed or ensuring all resource groups have tags in place.
